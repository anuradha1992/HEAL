To run the python scripts from the beginning, the Reddit dialogues dataset curated from a caefully chosen 8 psychological distress related subreddits, should be requested from the authors and be included inside the folder ./original. This dataset will not be publicly available due to ethical reasons.

The data files "dump", "indices_dump", and "cluster_dump" required to run the scripts and that are stored in pickle format can be downloaded through the following links:
